# Online-Library-System

An interactive **Online Library System** built with **React**, **React Router**, and **Redux**. This application allows users to explore book categories, view book details, search and filter books, and add new books—all within a polished, frontend experience.

Feel free to contribute improvements or file issues.

This project is educational and intended for demonstrating React + Redux functionality.

All book data is managed in-memory (no backend)—so all additions reset on page reload.
